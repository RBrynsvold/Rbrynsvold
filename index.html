<h1>Understanding and Preventing Burnout</h1>

	Worker burnout is an ongoing concern on both sides of the labor market.  Workers natually want to avoid burnout for their own quality of life, and employers must be concerned about the negative effects of burnout on productivity and employee retention.  And the problem of worker burnout has only been intensified by a global pandemic that upended the way we live and work, and further blurred the lines between home and personal life. <br> <br> 

This dataset relates worker burnout level (quantitatively summarized in the 'Burn Rate' attribute) to various personal and professional attributes.  These fields are:

<ul>
	<li><b>Date of Joining</b>: Date the employee joined his/her organization.  This data was collected from Jan to Dec 2008.</li>
	<li><b>Gender</b></li>
	<li><b>Company Type</b>: Product or Service</li>
	<li><b>WFH Setup Available</b></li>
	<li><b>Designation</b>: Seniority level - higher number = higher seniority</li>
	<li><b>Resource Allocation</b>: Work hours per day</li>
	<li><b>Mental Fatigue Score</b>: Self-reported stress rating</li>
</ul>
